# CalculateStatistics Tasks

1. Find the smallest value of an array of ints
1. Now that you have found the minium. Add some more statistically interesting results such as the:
    - Maximum
    - Range
    - Average
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Mode
    - Standard deviation
    - Variance
    - Inter-quartile range
    - etc.
1. Rather than hard-coding the numbers try to read the data from a file. One way to do this in java is by making use of the:
    - java.io.BufferedReader
    - java.io.FileReader
    
    Since a file may not exist, you will also have to handle the exceptional cases of filereading
1. Try to see if the program will also work with the other forms of data / make it work
1. That is all for now but when you've learned some more features of the language, come back and improve the:
    - readability
    - modularity
    - idiomaticity
