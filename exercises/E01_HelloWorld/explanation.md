# HelloWorld task

1. Follow the structure of a basic java program to print a message into the console. You can of course look at any solutions at any time. Java is not exactly an intuitive language.

Please note that not every solution contains "optimal" or "idiommatic" code. I try to avoid using constructs that have not already been discussed and I may write several versions to make the process of cleaning up code visible.
