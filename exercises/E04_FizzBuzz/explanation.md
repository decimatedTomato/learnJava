# FizzBuzz Tasks

1. Write a function that loops through a range of integers. It should print out the number to the standard out **except**, if the number is a multiple of 3 it is replaced by "Fizz", if it is a multiple of 5 it is replaced by "Buzz" and if it is a multiple of 15 it is replaced by "FizzBuzz"
1. You did great, but our *client* has new requirements, multiples of the numbers 7, 11, 13, 17 should be replaced with "Bazz", "Zip", "Zap" and "Zop" (if a number is divisible by multiple it will print the concatenation of these strings)

    Your solution must be scalable so that the client may add any number of number string pairs without complicating the codebase
