 * Maybe you want to use this class to always house the main method
 * (As we know main methods are annoying)
 * 
 * If you want to make use of command line arguments then add another main method inside of the class you are working on
 * Otherwise simply instantiate that class (we will explain this later)
 * and maybe call a start method on it
 * like so:
 *     new ClassName().start();
 * (the start method is not magic, you have to write it, I just think thats a name that fits with any program)
