# Introduction to Java

## Motivation
- I know of the java programming language, I can teach you.
- I found there is a lot of outdated and conflicting teaching around OOP, I aim to make it all more manageable.

## Prerequisites
- Able to read english (But the README is also written in english so this is probably the case)
- A little bit of programming know-how
- Curiosity
- Ability to ask follow up questions (to me or the internet)

## Completed
- Introduction to language features
- Introduction to OOP principles

## TODO
- Lectures slides for dynamic dispatch, multithreading, UI and external jars
- Exercises 7,8, 9
- Rename all of the exercise solutions to sensible names rather than just the order I wrote them in
